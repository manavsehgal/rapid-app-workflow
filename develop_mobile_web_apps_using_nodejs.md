# Develop Mobile Web Apps Using NodeJS

Among distribution methods and target platforms, developing web apps using NodeJS is most popular. Barrier to entry is lowest when developing in JavaScript. You just need a text editor, a terminal, and a GitHub account to get started. 

NodeJS enjoys tremendous growth in frameworks, language variants, tools, and technologies. This increases complexity non-linearly as project size grows.

## Distribution Methods for NodeJS

Here is a list of app distribution methods that NodeJS developers can choose from.

**Dynamic websites** distributed over the public Web using search engines to drive visitor traffic.

**Single page apps** designed responsively for mobile and desktop use cases. These mimic desktop or native-like features and are behind an authentication method in most cases.

**Mobile Web hybrid apps** designed using frameworks like Phonegap and Cordova.

**Server side apps** for back-end jobs on the server talking to a database or another front-end app.

**API endpoints** are server side apps with published application programming interface.

**Static generated web sites** where NodeJS runs on the development server. Generators pre-compile, package, and optimize HTML, CSS, and JS to serve as static assets.
