# Rapid App Workflow

> Rapid App Design, Development, and Distribution Workflow.

Modern day app development is complex. You face hundreds of micro-decisions during the life cycle of an app. From design, through development, to distribution. Here is a short list of such micro-decisions.

- How to research the target market and audience?
- How to prototype and generate ideas?
- What is the appropriate technology stack?
- How to setup fastest build pipeline?
- What are the best development tools for the job?
- Which programming language is most relevant?
- What libraries and frameworks work best together?
- How to distribute the app for success market adoption?

## How This Book Helps

This book helps you ease into these micro-decisions. We do this by creating the Rapid App Workflow. We target most popular distribution channels including iOS for mobile apps and NodeJS for web apps. Selecting best-of-breed frameworks, libraries, and tools which work well together.

## Who Should Read This Book

Primary audience for this book, like the author, is a single developer + designer + marketer. The power of one, extended with communities like the GitHub. The book focuses on individual productivity, speed-to-market, cost-effectiveness, and re-use.

The rapid app workflow can also adapt to small teams of four-to-five members.

The book follows modern day app life cycle for target platforms as the top level structure. Second level highlights a workflow step along with best-of-breed tool or technology chosen.

**Top level:** Design for iOS > Develop using Swift on XCode > Distribute on Apple App Store
