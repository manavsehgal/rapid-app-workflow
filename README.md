# Rapid App Workflow

> Rapid App Design, Development, and Distribution Workflow.

Modern day app development is complex. You face hundreds of micro-decisions during the life cycle of an app. From design, through development, to distribution. Here is a short list of such micro-decisions.

- How to research the target market and audience?
- How to prototype and generate ideas?
- What is the appropriate technology stack?
- How to setup the best build pipeline?
- What development tools to use?
- Where to distribute the app?

# How This Book Helps

This book helps you ease into these micro-decisions. We do this by creating Rapid App Workflow (RAW). A workflow for rapid designing, development, distribution of apps.

# Who Should Read This Book

Primary audience for this book, like the author, is a single developer + designer + marketer. The power of one, extended with communities like the GitHub. The book focuses on individual productivity, speed-to-market, cost-effectiveness, and re-use.

The rapid app workflow can also adapt to small teams of four-to-five members.
