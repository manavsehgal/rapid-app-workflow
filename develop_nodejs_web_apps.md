# Develop Node.js Web Apps

Among distribution methods and target platforms, developing web apps using Node.js is most popular. Barrier to entry is lowest when developing in JavaScript. You just need a text editor, terminal, and a GitHub account to get started.

Node.js enjoys tremendous growth in frameworks, language variants, tools, and technologies. This increases complexity non-linearly as project size grows.

## Distribution Methods for NodeJS

Here is a list of app distribution methods that Node.js developers can choose from.

**Dynamic websites** distributed over the public Web using search engines to drive visitor traffic.

**Single page apps** designed responsively for mobile and desktop use cases. These mimic desktop or native-like features and are behind an authentication method in most cases.

**Mobile Web hybrid apps** designed using frameworks like Phonegap and Cordova.

**Server side apps** for back-end jobs on the server talking to a database or another front-end app.

**API endpoints** are server side apps with published application programming interface.

**Static generated web sites** where Node.js runs on the development server. Generators pre-compile, package, and optimize HTML, CSS, and JS to serve as static assets.

## Recommended workflow for Node.js

- **Cloud9** for Web browser based code editing on the Cloud.

- **Webpack** for automating builds and packaging assets.
